## About CS50x 2020

[CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/) is Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course covers a broad range of topics including algorithms, data structures, software engineering, web development, and more.

## My Journey

I began my CS50x journey in the 8th grade, but due to various commitments like classes and exams, I paused for a while before resuming in the 9th grade. Despite the challenges, I persevered and successfully completed the course, earning a certificate of completion.

## Certificate

I successfully completed the CS50x 2020 course and obtained a certificate of completion. You can view my certificate [here](https://certificates.cs50.io/abe40da1-7bc8-4535-8746-5ba90797760c.png).
