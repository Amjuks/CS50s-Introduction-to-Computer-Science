                What is Scratch?
            </H2>
            <p>
                With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories,<br>
                games, and animations — and share your creations with others<br>
                in the online community.<br><br>

                Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason<br>
                systematically, and work collaboratively — essential skills for life<br>
                in the 21st century.<br><br>

                Scratch is a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the<br>
                MIT Media Lab. It is provided free of charge.<br>

            <p>
                Scratch was something that changed my life and I had made a lot of projects with it.<br>
                I have shared some projects on the Scratch website which looked worth being shown.<br>
                Have a look at them!

                    <td>This was my second project and it took me 3 months as well. I had to do some complex coding for a starter, and it sure helped a lot! Everything was a lot fun since then!

                    <td>I started to have a liking towards trig functions, I thought I would use them to show 3D figures which can rotate at a specific point. You can use the arrow keys
                    to rotate it!</td>

                I had made a lot of other stuff but haven't shared them since they didn't look worth it. Feel free to play the ones I have mentioned above!
