                    What is Instagram?
                </H2>
                <p>
                    Instagram (commonly abbreviated to IG or Insta) is an American<br>
                    photo and video sharing social networking service owned by Facebook,<br>
                    created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger and originally launched on<br>
                    iOS in October 2010.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a<br>
                    feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in<br>
                    June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. The app allows<br>
                    users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by<br>
                    hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly<br>
                    or with pre-approved followers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations and view<br>
                    trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users to add<br>
                    their content to a feed, a function that seems to be discontinued<br>
                    as of September 2020.

                <H2>How it all started</H2>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    I was 13 when I joined here. I had seen a lot of people using it<br>
                    and I had started to get a curious what it was all about. After a while<br>
                    I decided that I would use this app and find out what it was all about.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had hesitated for a when I decided to install it, but I installed it<br>
                    anyways. I created an account for myself and entered my details. Not<br>
                    realizing I had to keep personal info private I had enetered my name,<br>
                    that didn't matter much since I had no followers so it was pretty much<br>
                    private as well. I replaced with my common name on social meidas(Amjuks)<br>
                    there as well.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class = "insta-img">
                <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/amjuks_/">
                <img src = "instaProfile" alt = "IG profile for Amjuks">
                </a>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class = "flex reverse">
            <div class = "insta-what text">
                <H2>What I started to do</H2>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Everything was a bit awkward for me at the beginning as it was my<bt>
                    first time on a social media. I started by following random people<br>
                    and my friends. I had about 30 followers on day 2, and I felt quite<br>
                    proud of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But that's where it stopped, and after a few days I didn't care much<br>
                    about gaining followers. I started to scroll through random people's<br>
                    profile and decided I would share somethings as well. I wasn't sure<br>
                    what I would post so I decided that I would know what to post<br>
                    when the time comes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That were my expectations but I started to run out of patience.<br>
                    I found random wallpapers on some books and took their photos<br>
                    and filetered them, and posted them. Plagiarism was something<br>
                    I was good at when I was 13, I regretted doing it now. But my<br>
                    conscience wouldn't allow me to remove the things I had posted<br>
                    so i decided I will leave it where it was.

            <H2>The time I started posting my own stuff</H2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Everything I did until then was plagiarism. I decided to stop<br>
                doing it and start posting my own stuff. Whenever I saw a cloud<br>
                or a scenary with trees or mounatains while travelling, I had<br>
                taken photos of those.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wasn't sure which one I must post, but before I realized<br>
                I had already posted some of those. I didn't regret doing it<br>
                but I sure wondered why I had posted only 2 out of a dozen<br>
                things I had captured.
            </p>
            <p>
                I noticed that when I started posting my own stuff, I<br>
                started to gain some followers. That encouraged me to post<br>
                my own stuff.
